This is a open-source class designed to make Calculus easier to implement in C++.
PolynomialC's polynomials can do the following.
- ALGEBRA
  - Addition with constants and other polynomials.
  - Subtraction with constants and other polynomials.
  - Multiplication with constants and other polynomials.
  - Division with constants.
  - Raise polynomials to powers of constants.
  - Solve the polynomial and return one number.
- CALCULUS
  - Integrate polynomials with respect to x.
  - Differentiate polynomials with respect to x.
  - Approximate values for sine, cosine, e^x, and ln(x) with 1000 terms.
    - The ln(x) function may produce inaccurate values with added with other non-logarithmic polynomials.
    - I must emphasize, these are approximations.  Inaccurate results may be produced for high values of x.

This class is available for all to use.  I only ask for credit if you use this code.
