# Welcome to PolynomialC!

This is a open-source class designed to make math easier to implement in C++.  PolynomialC adds polynomials to C++.  These polynomials only have one variable for its calculations: x.  These polynomials can be used for algebra and calculus.  Here are some features of PolynomialC.
## Algebra
- Addition with constants and other polynomials.
- Subtraction with constants and other polynomials.
- Multiplication with constants and other polynomials.
- Division with constants.
- Raise polynomials to powers of constants.
- Solve the polynomial and return one number.
## Calculus
- Integrate polynomials with respect to x.
- Differentiate polynomials with respect to x.
- Approximate values for sine, cosine, e^x, and ln(x) with 1000 terms.
  - The ln(x) function may produce inaccurate values with added with other non-logarithmic polynomials.
  - I must emphasize, these are approximations.  Inaccurate results may be produced for high values of x.
- Find zeros for polynomials using an iterative process.

This class is available for all to use.  I only ask for credit if you use this code.
